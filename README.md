Story : As an entrepreneur, I want to have DashBoards so I can create an app that helps people manage their stress through sleep management. With two datasets, and seeks to understand whether there is a correlation between stress and sleep in order to create an application to reduce stress.

![Intro](https://github.com/LMatheo/Portfolio/assets/139975373/fd4cf28a-473e-4032-a6e0-4520b481078c)
1.  Analysis of one of the data sets provided by the CEO
- Let's start with the first hypothesis, that there is a correlation between sleep and stress.
- The first dataset contains data on the lifestyle and stress levels of 374 people. From this data, we selected those that were most relevant to our analysis in this dashboard.
- Of the 374 people: men/women 50/50
- Average stress level: 5.39 out of 8
- We can see the professions of the respondents and that those in the medical sector are the most stressed.
- We can see a correlation between sleep and stress: at 34, low peak sleep quality vs. high peak stress level.

2. To show the evolution of these measures according to the level of stress, we put them all on the same scale, taking as a base 100 for each measure for stress level 0. 
The more stress
- Eye movement increases
- Heart rate increases
- Snoring increases (almost doubles)
- Breathing rate increases
- Body movements double
-Body temperature, hours of sleep and blood oxygen levels decrease

3. The entrepreneur also wanted us to help him before the launch, so we collected data from 6 potential competitors and analysed the comments from the best and worst performers.
- Over 84,000 reviews in total
- We can see that the scores are generally high: this proves that this type of app is popular and therefore profitable.
- We decided to analyse the different types of comments over time and look at the peaks. 
- We then extracted these comments to highlight the most common words in order to understand good and bad practices.
This analysis is particularly interesting for analysing the negative comments to gain the most insights: we can see that price is an argument that has a lot of influence, as well as technical bugs and the ease of use of the interface.

4. To position themselves and offer the CEO the best prices to enter the market.
- It can be seen that free apps are rated lower, probably because they are less effective.
- More expensive apps are also rated lower: customers have higher expectations and are therefore more likely to be disappointed in the event of a problem.
